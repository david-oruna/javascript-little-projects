# JS Little Projects

## This is a repository to learn JavaScript, HTML & CSS by creating simple and fun projects 😎

Since a long time ago I wanted to learn something of frontend development and I realized that one of the best ways to learn is by practicing and having fun. 🌟

Feel free to contribute by adding more features or with your own projects 😇
